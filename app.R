# CHANGELOG
#
# 31-03-2020 - added log scale to plot 1
#              added ip to figure title
#              figure titles now include "Supplemental"
#              "total epidemic size changed" to "cumulative epidemic size"
#              scale on R0 slider now 1-5 for all panels
#              defaults: R0=3 (panel 1, 2) R0mitigated=2 (panel 2), to match values in columns
# 02-04-2020   added tables
#              in panel 2, intermediate R0 curves are off by default but can be turned on
#              factored out VAR = VALUE strings in text to varfmt()
#              increased time steps to 5000
# 03-04-2020   factored out some functions into {ggplot,format}.helpers.R
#              factored out plot drawing into separate functions that return lists of plots, indexes and titles
#              formatted figure titles
#              added citation masthead
#              added Nat Meth branding masthead

# 07-04-2020   Renamed some variables.
#              Streamlined and updated CSS.
#              Removed fixed plot height and aspect ratio
# 09-04-2020   added debug timings
#              reduced time steps to 1000 to decrease load on server
